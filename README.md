Bits of code written as I learn the basics of Python, designed to mimic the sorts of gimmicks and games found in a classic seaside amusement arcade. The prizes aren't real, but the projects are written to function just like the real thing.

ONE CHANCE, ONE SPIN, ONE WIN --- THE WORLD'S QUICKEST FRUIT MACHINE

This simple fruit machine randomly selects 3 objects from a list and the player is rewarded according to how many matches are generated. If all three objects match, the code prints that the player has won £10. If two objects match, the code prints that the player has won £5. First draft code uploaded 28/05. Further edits required. Edits complete 21/06.
